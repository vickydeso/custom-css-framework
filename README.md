# Azure Framework
**Azure Framework** is a sleek and modern CSS framework that is designed to add sophistication to your web projects. Inspired by the smooth curves of the popular Poppins font and the calming hues of deep, soft blues reminiscent of azure skies, this framework offers a balanced blend of style and functionality.

## Installation
You can install Azure Framework via npm by adding this in your terminal:
```
npm install poppin-azure-framework
```

Or you can include the minified CSS file directly in your HTML:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/poppin-azure.min.css">
```

## Usage
Once installed, you can use the framework by adding the appropriate classes to your HTML elements. The list of HTML elements and utility classes included in the framework can be found below.

## Customization
To customize the framework, you can override the default styles or use custom variables. If you installed via npm, you can import the Sass files and modify them by adding this line of code to your web project:
```
@import 'path/to/poppin-azure-framework/variables';
@import 'path/to/poppin-azure-framework';
```

Instead, you can also override the CSS file directly in your own CSS file like so:
```.custom-styling {
background-color: #CDDEFF;
color: black;
}
```
